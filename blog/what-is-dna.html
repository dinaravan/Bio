  <h1>What is DNA?</h1>
  <p><i>Published: May 2025</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecular blueprint for all living organisms. It carries the instructions necessary for life and is passed down from one generation to the next.</p>

  <p>In this post, we'll explore the structure of DNA, how it replicates, and why it's so fundamental to biology and medicine.</p>

  <h2>The Double Helix</h2>
  <p>The famous double-helix shape was discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953. DNA is composed of four types of nucleotides: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). These base pairs connect in specific ways: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G.</p>

  <h2>Why DNA Matters</h2>
  <p>Understanding DNA has allowed scientists to identify genetic disorders, solve crimes, and even develop personalized medicine. It's one of the most powerful discoveries in science.</p>
